1.Express Generator: Express Generator is a tool used to quickly scaffold the basic structure of a web application using the Express.js framework, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js. The generator provides a set of predefined directory structures, files, and boilerplate code to help kickstart the development of an Express.js application.

- By using Express Generator, developers can save time and effort in setting up the initial project structure, configuring routes, and handling common tasks. It is particularly useful for creating the basic skeleton of an application, allowing developers to focus on implementing specific features rather than spending time on repetitive setup tasks.

- To use Express Generator, we install it globally on our machine.

- steps to use express generator:
1. npm i express-generator -g
